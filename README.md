## What is ZoominLife

```
ZoominLife is a mock website created by students with the purpose of learning how to collaborate as a group. As our first group project we were able to use GitHub as a small group and learn collaborative functionality such as: using branches, merging, solving merge conflicts, and using the Projects board.
